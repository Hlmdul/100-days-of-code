# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 26, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: CSS Basic Layouting, Python strings tutorial (review)

**Thoughts:** I'm already somewhat confident in my ability on CSS and HTML, i feel like i just need to get the repetition down and i will be able to master them in no time (hopefully). as in Python, i feel the same, for the basic functionality i feel like i just need to get the repetition done and try to find exercise/project ideas.

**Link to work:** 
1. [CSS Position] (https://github.com/Hlmdul/CSS-Layout)
2. [Learn Python] (https://github.com/Hlmdul/learn-python3)
