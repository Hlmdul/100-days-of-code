# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 26, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: CSS Basic Layouting, Python strings tutorial (review)

**Thoughts:** I'm already somewhat confident in my ability on CSS and HTML, i feel like i just need to get the repetition down and i will be able to master them in no time (hopefully). as in Python, i feel the same, for the basic functionality i feel like i just need to get the repetition done and try to find exercise/project ideas.

### Day 1: November 27, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Bootstrap, preparation class of a 3-month AI Bootcamp (review)

**Thoughts:** today i've learnt about some basic of bootstrap framework, and i have finished my first preparation class of AI bootcamp. A pretty exhausting day of coding but very exciting at the same time.

1. [Bootstrap Assignment] (haven't pushed it to github)

### Day 2: November 28, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Python data structure and manipulation

**Thoughts:** Having a blast learning (reviewing) python data structure today, ending my day feeling sort of satisfied with my coding progress today with a little bit more digging into Ubuntu (learing about some basic command). might do a little session of bootstrap before sleep.
